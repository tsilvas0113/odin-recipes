This will be a simple recipe website to practice some basic HTML knowledge. It will consist of a main index page which will link to a few recipes. After completing the website, I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills including: setting up the usual boilerplate HTML, working with headings, creating and utilizing multiple directories, working with links, implementing images, and employing unordered and ordered lists.
