    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's an ooey, gooey, cheesy, spicy, and oh-so satisfying combination of
      pantry staple ingredients you probably already have on hand.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetables</li>
      <li>Canned Soup</li>
      <li>Canned Tomatoes and Chile Peppers</li>
      <li>Chicken Broth</li>
      <li>Sour Cream</li>
      <li>Spices and Seasonings</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sauté the onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper until they're
        warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together the sautéed vegetables, canned soups, diced tomatoes,
        chicken broth, sour cream, and spices in a large bowl until the
        ingredients are well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a few tablespoons of the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
        Top the sauce with about half the chicken. Spread half the sauce over
        the chicken, then top with ⅓ of the cheese. Arrange a layer of tortillas
        over the cheese. Add remaining chicken, then top with the remaining
        sauce (reserving ½ cup). Top with ½ of the remaining cheese and
        remaining tortillas, then with the reserved sauce, and the remaining
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F until bubbling. Set the oven
        to broil, then cook for another few minutes until the top is golden.
      </li>
    </ol>
